I'm passionate about public engagement and science education. Over the years, I have developed [instructional design materials](#instructional-design) on ecology and research for undergraduate and broader audience -- check out the collaborative project ["EcoEvoApps"](#ecoevoapps) for simulating mathematical models in EEB, and my earlier [tutorials on research and writing](#wire) at UCLA Library.

I have also been involved in [public engagement](#public-engagement), especially on topics related to science and nature. I have been a volunteer docent with the UT-student-run ["Science Under the Stars"](#suts) program, and with the [Zilker Botanical Garden](#zilker) in Austin. I was a previous docent at the UCLA [Mathias Botanical Garden](#mathias). I have also given [public lectures](#public-lectures) on microbes and cultural use of plants.

### Instructional Designs <a name="instructional-design"></a>
#### Ecoevoapps, interactive apps to teach EEB models (2020-present) <a name="ecoevoapps"></a>
In this collaborative project, we developed a set of interactive web apps to simulate EEB models, implemented them into undergraduate classes at two universities, and layed down frameworks allowing for on-going contribution and use around the world.

Explore our [apps](https://ecoevoapps.gitlab.io/), view our [project repository](https://gitlab.com/ecoevoapps/ecoevoapps), and read our [paper in Ecology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9556) for details. This fall, I will be incorporating the apps as I TA for Ecology at UT.

#### Writing instruction & research education at UCLA library (2019-2020) <a name="wire"></a>
I worked as an instructional designer at WI+RE (Writing instruction & research education), creating online tutorials and workshops to make research more assibile to undergraduate students.

### Public engagement <a name="public-engagement"></a>
#### Volunteer at Science Under the Stars (2022-present) <a name="suts"></a>
[SUTS[(https://scienceunderthestars.org/) is a free monthly public lecture series run by graduate students in the Integrative Biology Department at UT Austin. In addition to the lecture itself, each event also features a natural history table, a kids activity table, and a natural history tour, all with relevant themes. 

Since 2022 I have mostly volunteered as a docent for the program, leading 30-min tours around the UT Brackenridge Field Laboratory where the event happens. I focus on the history and natural history of this field station, as well as the diversity of research happening there.

Deer shed their antlers every year, which were collected and tracked to individuals by the field station director Prof. Larry Gilbert." width="400" height="300" %}

#### Docent at Zilker Botanical Gardent (2022-present) <a name="zilker"></a>
Since 2022 I have volunteered as a docent at the local botanical garden in Austin. I lead 1-hour tours to school groups and general public, highlighting garden history, fun facts about plants, as well as plant evolution, food webs, ecosystems, and sustainability. I also help with garden education events like the annual Roots & Wings Festival and Dino Day.

#### Docent at Mathias Botanical Garden (2018-2020) <a name="mathias"></a>
Similar to my current role at Zilker Botanical Garden, at Mathias Botanical Garden I volunteered as a garden docent and helped with education programs during my undergrad at the UCLA.

#### Public lectures <a name="public-lectures"></a>
In November 2022, I gave a public lecture on the importance of microbes for plants, people, and the ecosystem. The talk happened on site twice, once with SUTS at the Brackenridge Field Laboratory (60+ audience), and once with the Neighborhood Science Program at the Austin Public Library Howson Branch(~10 audience). It was also streamed and [recoded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJj9oR5TdLQ) on YouTube (check out [more SUTS talks](https://www.youtube.com/@scienceunderthestars351))  

In December 2020, I gave a [virtual talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jL8RUe9woc&feature=youtu.be) for the "Botany of the Holidays" series by UCLA Mathias Botanical Garden, featuring the Laba Garlic. I talked about garlic (*Allium sativum*), the chemistry of its green-turning process, and the mportance of this food in the winter tradition of Northern China.
