I am a EEB graduate student at University of Texas at Austin, co-advised by Dr. [Farrior](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/cfarrior) and Dr. [Wolf](https://ameliawolf.weebly.com/). I am interested in plant microbe interactions, and study how they influence plant diversity and ecosystem functions.

Here, you can read about my ecology projects 🌲, instructional design materials 📝, and artworks 🎨.
