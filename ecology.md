excerpt: "How plant-microbe interactions shape diversity"
aside: true

Interactiona between plants and soil microbes are common in nature, and have a pivotal role in mediating plant succession, invasion, and species coexistence. 


## 2020-present
### A meta-analysis on microbially mediated fitness difference
We conduct a meta-analysis on the microbially mediated fitness differences and compare its magnitude with the frequency dependence, to infer coexistence outcomes.

This is a current project collaborate with Jonathan Levine and GauraWe are presenting at [ESA 2021] (https://www.esa.org/longbeach/). Check out my talk at COS 20: Species Interactions 2.

### plant-microbe interaction as a way to produce evolutionarily stable coexistebce
Using adaptive dynamics, we explore if plant-microbe interactions, e.g. Janzen-Connell effects, can allow plant species to have evolutionarily stable coexistence.

This is in-progress project with my advisor Caroline Farrior. Stay tuned.

## 2019-2020
### A greenhouse experiment


## 2018-2019
### A theory paper on microbially mediated fitness difference
