## 2020-present
#### Ecoevoapps, interactive apps to teach EEB models
In this collaborative project, we developed a set of interactive web apps to simulate EEB models, implemented them into undergraduate classes at two universities, and layed down frameworks allowing for on-going contribution and use around the world.

Explore our [apps](https://ecoevoapps.gitlab.io/), view our [project repository](https://gitlab.com/ecoevoapps/ecoevoapps), and read our [manuscripts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.18.449026v1.full) for details.

## 2019-2020
#### Writing instruction & research education at UCLA library
I worked as an instructional designer at WI+RE (Writing instruction & research education), creating online tutorials and workshops to make research more assibile to undergraduate students.

Check out the website for [instructional materials](https://uclalibrary.github.io/research-tips/) and more.

#### Public outreach at Mildred Mathias botanical garden
I volunteered as a garden docent to give educational garden tours to school groups and general public.
