I was born and raised in the Yangtze Delta region of China. The subtropical monsoon climate fosters lush and diverse plants that have fascinated me to explore plant ecology. <br>
I studied Biology and Applied Math at UCLA and proceed to pursue a PhD in Ecology at UT Ausin. More of my academic background can be found at my **[cv](assets/Xinyi_Yan_cv.pdf)**. <br>
I love spending time in nature and painting. I also find it meaningful to participate in public engagement and develop instructional design materials, which integrates my passion for science, education, and design.
