I am a EEB graduate student at University of Texas at Austin, co-advised by Dr. [Farrior](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/cfarrior) and Dr. [Wolf](https://ameliawolf.weebly.com/). I am interested in plant microbe interactions, and study how they influence plant diversity and ecosystem functions. <br>
Here, you can read about my ecology projects 🌲, instructional design materials 📝, and artworks 🎨.  

💥 2025 Summer/Fall Special: I plan to graduate in Summer 2026 and am currently seeking a postdoct position. My interests lie in community ecology, particularly in linking theory with experiments on plant–microbe interactions. I bring strong quantitative and hands-on skills. Feel free to explore my CV and current projects for more details, and I’d be happy to connect at ESA!
