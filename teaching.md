I'm passionate about public engagement and science education. Over the years, I have developed [instructional design materials](#instructional-design) on ecology and research for undergraduate and broader audience -- check out the collaborative project ["EcoEvoApps"](#ecoevoapps) for simulating mathematical models in EEB, and my earlier [tutorials on research and writing](#wire) at UCLA Library.

I have also been involved in public engagement, especially on topics related to science and nature. I have been a volunteer docent with the UT-student-run "Science Under the Stars (SUTS)" program, and with the Zilker Botanical Garden in Austin. I was a previous docent at the UCLA Mildred Mathias Botanical Garden. I have also given public lectures at SUTS and at the Mathias Botanical Garden relating to soil microbes and cultural use of plants.

#### Ecoevoapps, interactive apps to teach EEB models (2020-present) <a name="ecoevoapps"></a>
In this collaborative project, we developed a set of interactive web apps to simulate EEB models, implemented them into undergraduate classes at two universities, and layed down frameworks allowing for on-going contribution and use around the world.

Explore our [apps](https://ecoevoapps.gitlab.io/), view our [project repository](https://gitlab.com/ecoevoapps/ecoevoapps), and read our [manuscripts]((https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9556) for details.

#### Writing instruction & research education at UCLA library (2019-2020) <a name="wire"></a>
I worked as an instructional designer at WI+RE (Writing instruction & research education), creating online tutorials and workshops to make research more assibile to undergraduate students.
