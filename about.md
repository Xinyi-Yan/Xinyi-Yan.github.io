I was born and raised in the Yangtze Delta region of China. The subtropical monsoon climate fosters lush and diverse plants that have fascinated me to explore plant ecology. <br>
I studied Biology and Applied Math at UCLA as an undergrad and proceed to pursue a PhD in Ecology at UT Ausin. More of my academic background can be found at my **[cv](assets/Xinyi_Yan_cv-Aug20.pdf)**. <br>
I love spending time in nature and painting. I also find it meaningful to develop instructional design materials, which integrates my passion for science, education, and design.
