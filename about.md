I was born and raised in the Yangtze Delta region of China. The subtropical monsoon climate fosters lush and diverse plants that have fascinated me and inspired me to explore plant ecology. <br>
I studied Biology and Applied Math at UCLA as an undergrad and proceed to pursue a PhD in Ecology at UT Ausin. <br>
To know more about my academic background, you can read my **[cv](assets/Xinyi_Yan_cv-Aug20.pdf)**. <br>
